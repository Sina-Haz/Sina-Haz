Hello!

My name is Sina Hazeghi and I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers New Brunswick majoring in Math and Computer Science. My primary interests are machine learning, software development, and artificial intelligence. Contact me at shazeghian@gmail.com

Below you'll find summaries and highlights of my current repositories:

##Academic Projects

[Computer Architecture](https://github.com/Sina-Haz/Computer-Architecture-Projects)

Project 1:
 - Implement ordered link lists and stacks and queues in pa1/second and pa1/third respectively
 - Under pa1/fifth you will find a Matrix Determinant calculator that works for n x n square matrices using dynamically allocated 2D arrays

Project 2:
 - In pa2/third and pa2/fourth I implement BFS and DFS traversal algorithms respectively
 - Under pa2/fifth I find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph using Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm along with a topsorting algorithm to identify whether a graph is directed and acyclic
 - pa2/sixth solves the shortest path problem for undirected graphs using Djikstra's algorithm
 - pa2/ninth and tenth convert decimals to IEEE-754 FP format and back respectively
